# CombAntImuSel

## Compbination of artificial immune genetic algorithm and metaheuristic ant colony optimizer with two-dose vaccination and modeling

In this repo feature selection optimizer methodes such as Ant colony and Immune system have been investigated. Also, the dataset is highly confidential and eliminated. Therefore, fell free to use your dataset. Note that the machine learning models used in these codes is SVR and you can simply change it as it already has been imported.

### Ant_alogo.py and run_ant.ipynb 
These codes run Ant colony optimizer.

### run_immune_local.ipynb and run_immune_vaccine.ipynb

These codes demonstrate the use of feature selection methodes. The first one uses artificial immune genetic algorithm with local vaccination. Also, the second one uses the combination with ant colony as a immune system with two-dose vaccination.
